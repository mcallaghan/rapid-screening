# Statistical stopping criteria for automated screening in systematic reviews

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper [Statistical stopping criteria for automated screening in systematic reviews](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-020-01521-4) by Max Callaghan and Finn Müller-Hansen.

The code behind the stopping criteria has since been rationalised and better documented, and is available in package form for [R](https://mcallaghan.github.io/buscarR/) and [Python](https://buscarpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If you want to apply the stopping criteria in your own project. Take a look at the example in `analysis/minimal_example.ipynb`.
